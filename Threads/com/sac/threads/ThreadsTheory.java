/**
 * Multitasking -> Creates a seperate process for each task and cpu switch
 * between them very fast. We are putting more preasure on CPU as it has to
 * switch among different process
 * 
 * Multithreading - > We create One process and devide that process to allocate
 * tasks. Means cpu needs to switch among tasks in a same process hence less
 * pleasure on CPU
 * 
 * 
 * To take advantage of multiple cores from our software, ultimately threads
 * have to be used. Because of this fact, some developers fall in the trap of
 * equating multithreading to parallelism. That is not accurate...You can have
 * multithreading on a single core machine, but you can only have parallelism on
 * a multi core machine
